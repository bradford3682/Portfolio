<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, I’m Bradford Mcdaniel – a U.S. Army veteran turned aspiring software engineer, with over three years of professional experience as a Software Support Engineer. My passion lies in building efficient, scalable solutions and continuously improving my programming skills to make an impact in the tech world.</p>

<p>My journey into software development began with a foundation in Computer Science and evolved through roles troubleshooting complex software issues and scripting solutions to help businesses succeed. These experiences taught me the importance of adaptability, problem-solving, and resilience – values I carry into every project I undertake.</p>

Currently, I’m focused on expanding my expertise in backend development, honing skills in Python, Java, and cloud technologies like AWS. I’m actively working on personal projects, certifications, and coursework to bridge the gap between my support engineering background and my goal of becoming a proficient software developer.

<p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading about creative problem-solving and exploring new ways to grow professionally. I’m excited about the future and open to roles that offer challenges, mentorship, and opportunities for growth.

Let’s connect and build something amazing together! </p>
